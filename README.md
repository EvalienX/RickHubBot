# RickHubBot

## -Project overview!
Simple discord bot to resolve all your rickroll needs!

## -Getting started on the project!
To download from GitHub, you should navigate to the top level of the project (SDN in this case) and then a green "Code" download button will be visible on the right. Choose the Download ZIP option from the Code pull-down menu. That ZIP file will contain the entire repository content, including the area you wanted. That's the best way to download from GitHub.

### - Cloning!
1. In the File menu, click Clone Repository.
2. Click the tab that corresponds to the location of the repository you want to clone. You can also click URL to manually enter the repository location.

4. Click Choose... and navigate to a local path where you want to clone the repository.
5. Click Clone.

## Creating your development environment!

- Node.js
1. Download the Windows installer from Nodejs.org.
2. Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)
